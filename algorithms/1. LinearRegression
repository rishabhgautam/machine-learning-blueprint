# 📘 **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable. It provides a simple yet powerful baseline for many regression tasks and forms the foundation for more advanced ML algorithms.

---

## **1. Introduction to Linear Regression**

Linear Regression estimates the relationship between features and a target by fitting a straight line (or hyperplane) that minimizes prediction error. It is widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency.

---

## **2. Simple vs Multiple Linear Regression**

* **Simple Linear Regression:** One predictor and one target.
* **Multiple Linear Regression:** Multiple predictors contributing to the target.

---

## **3. Mathematical Formulation**

[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_n x_n
]

Where:

* ( \beta_0 ) is intercept
* ( \beta_1 \dots \beta_n ) are coefficients
* ( \hat{y} ) is predicted output

---

## **4. Cost Function (MSE / RSS)**

* **RSS (Residual Sum of Squares):**
  [
  RSS = \sum (y - \hat{y})^2
  ]
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error):**
  [
  MSE = \frac{1}{m}\sum (y - \hat{y})^2
  ]

The objective is to minimize this error.

---

## **5. Optimization Approaches**

### **Normal Equation**

Closed-form solution:
[
\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
]

### **Gradient Descent Variants**

* Batch Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

---

## **6. From-Scratch Implementation Structure**

A typical implementation includes:

* Initializing parameters
* Computing predictions
* Calculating cost
* Updating parameters via gradient descent
* Iterating until convergence

---

## **7. Feature Engineering for Linear Regression**

Common techniques:

* Scaling and normalization
* Polynomial features
* Encoding categorical variables
* Handling outliers
* Interaction terms

---

## **8. Regularization Techniques**

### **Ridge Regression (L2)**

Adds penalty on squared coefficients.

### **Lasso Regression (L1)**

Adds penalty on absolute coefficients; performs feature selection.

### **Elastic Net**

Combines L1 and L2 penalties.

---

## **9. Model Evaluation Metrics**

* **MSE**
* **RMSE**
* **MAE**
* **R² Score**
* **Adjusted R²**

---

## **10. Residual Analysis & Diagnostics**

Residual analysis helps identify:

* Non-linearity
* Heteroscedasticity
* Outliers
* Non-normal errors

Key plots:

* Residual vs Fitted
* Q-Q Plot
* Histogram of residuals

---

## **11. Assumptions of Linear Regression (Tabular Form)**

| **Assumption**             | **Meaning**                                          | **How to Check**                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Linearity**              | Relationship between predictors and target is linear | Residual plots, scatter plots               |
| **Independence of Errors** | Residuals should not be correlated                   | Durbin–Watson test, time-series plots       |
| **Homoscedasticity**       | Constant variance of residuals                       | Residual vs fitted plot, Breusch–Pagan test |
| **Normality of Errors**    | Residuals follow a normal distribution               | Q-Q plot, Shapiro–Wilk test                 |
| **No Multicollinearity**   | Predictors should not be highly correlated           | VIF, correlation matrix                     |

---

## **12. Multicollinearity & VIF**

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) identifies correlated predictors.

* **VIF > 5–10** indicates high multicollinearity.
  Possible fixes:
* Remove correlated features
* Combine features
* Use Ridge Regression

---

## **13. When Linear Regression Works Well**

* Relationship is approximately linear
* Low multicollinearity
* Large sample size
* Model interpretability is important

---

## **14. When Linear Regression Fails**

* Non-linear relationships
* High correlation among predictors
* Presence of outliers
* Heteroscedasticity
* Many categorical variables without proper encoding

---

## **15. Real-World Applications**

* Sales forecasting
* Pricing models
* Risk assessment
* Marketing and ROI prediction
* Resource planning
* Telecom demand modeling

---

## **16. Scikit-Learn Implementation**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

preds = model.predict(X_test)
```
